Prices are dependent on complexity. These are just minimum prices.<br>
Contact me on either Discord, Twitter, or by email for commission requests.<br>
I operate on a "see before you buy" policy.

TOS

You waive the right to refund or chargeback after the commission is done.

Payment is done after you are happy with your commission in what I want to be paid in.
This includes Discord Nitro, Steam games/gift cards, etc.

You get 5 free revisions after the commission is done. Anything else after that is paid.

I reserve the right to cancel your commission at any time.

WIP screenshots are for viewing and showing your approval and are *not* to be used before you pay.

AS THE COMMISSIONER, YOU CAN:

Use my work for commercial use.
Modify it in any way you desire (PNG and SVG).
Use it on any website you want. 

AS THE COMMISSIONER, YOU CANNOT:

Take credit for my work.
Try to scam me for my work. 

OPTIONAL THINGS I WOULD APPRECIATE:

Crediting me wherever you use the logo.
A simple "Logo by Zetvue" and linking to my website is perfectly fine.

Spreading the word!
I love doing design, and I would love to make more!

Violating this TOS is subject to a permanent blacklist from commissioning me.
